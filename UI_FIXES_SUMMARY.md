# 🛠️ UI Fixes Summary

## 🎯 Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Logo Display Issue
**Problem**: Only "F" was showing instead of the full "Freshed" logo text on mobile devices
**Root Cause**: CSS class `hidden sm:inline-block` was hiding the text on small screens
**Fix**: Removed the responsive hiding classes to show the full logo text on all screen sizes

### 2. Search Bar Placement Issue
**Problem**: Search bar was appearing in the mobile menu instead of being integrated within the products page
